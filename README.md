Code for arXived paper: [Dynamics of discrete spacetimes with Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19538)

This code builds a quantum sampling algorithm, equivalent to the classical computational methods from CST: [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05902), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11647), [3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.6244).
The quantum process is based on Layden's work on the [Quantum enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06095-4), with the addition of the transitive closure constraint.

The project is ongoing - so updates should be expected.
